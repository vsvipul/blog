title: Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2019 with Zulip
---
Great news for y'all!<br>
I have been selected for [GSoC 2019](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#6477835160518656).

I am working with [Zulip](github.com/zulip/) this summer and am focusing on the desktop client of Zulip. My journey for GSoC started on 30th January 2019. From that particular day, I have been working with Zulip and when the results were declared on 7th May 2019, i was out for a hackathon in Delhi and couldn't exactly see the results while travelling as the internet wasn't working. So, my friends called me up to give me the news and congrats me. I was so happy that my hard work (and neglecting my academic work for contributing to Zulip), had finally paid off.

### Something about me

Currenty, I have finished my second year at IIT Mandi, and all set to become a Junior from next semester. I had made some small projects earlier, but GSoC is the first time I am working on something which is used worldwide on a large scale. 

### Working with Zulip

My journey with Zulip has been great and very exciting so far. Zulip’s well-maintained docs and codebase as an open source organization have been an additional benefit for me. Zulip’s mentors’ prompt response to new contributors and highly detailed documentation helped me get started by making contributions to zulip in no time. Strict code review, extensive tests and linters were a first-time for me, and I liked them as they taught me how work is done in large organizations. I have been personally been very interested in zulipbot, which overcomes the flaws in the Github workflow. <br>
Also, I was very intrigued to see that how a well-knit programming community can help in maintaining such a large-scale project by working together. I am excited about contributing to Zulip in the future as well. 


### Project Abstract

My main objective of the proposed project is to improve Zulip’s electron-based client application by migrating complete codebase to typescript, migrating to BrowserView, bug fixing and adding new features.


### Monthly Blogging

I have still to figure out how often would I post on this blog. I am planning something of a monthly update posts but that'd depend on how fast my work progresses.
